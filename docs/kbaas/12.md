# Manage Workgroup hosts with Server Manager

The bellow instructions were tested using Windows 10 LTSC and Windows Server 2022 23H2.

## On the host running Server Manager

Add remote server to the trusted hosts

```powershell
> Set-Item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts <remote host fqdn> -concatenate -force
```

## On the host being managed (core, non-core)

Using `SConfig.exe`, enable Remote Management.

```power
> Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Event Log Management"
```
